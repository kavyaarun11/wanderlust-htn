# Technologies being used

React, Firebase, HTML/CSS/JS, Particle.js, Material-UI

## Inspiration

Recently, 3 members of the Wanderlust team had gone on vacation. They realized it was quite hard coordinating all the tickets, bookings, and itineraries as they were all on different platforms. This was the inspiration behind creating an app that basically puts all your travel bookings and schedules together as one.

## What it does

Wanderlust is an application where users can create an account using their email, and essentially "create new trips", where they can later add in various trip bookings include transportation bookings (plane, ferry, train, etc), hotel bookings,

## How we built it

We built it using React JS, and for the UI components, we used Material UI, Particle.JS, and other React UI libraries. We used Firebase for the authentication and Firestore as the backend to store all the data.

## Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge we ran into was being able to route the card component with another page. It took us almost 6 hours and meetings with many htn mentors before we were able to figure it out!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

With the time given, we were able to get a full react project up and running, with various responsive card components, routing, and user data storage. We also have a fully functional login page with creating UI designs, which we're extremely proud of.

## What we learned

We all started off with little to no knowledge about React, and React libraries such as Material UI. Through this project, we were able to learn React inside out, and working on a challenging React-router problem for almost 6 hours, allowed us to learn about react components and how a react app all comes together. This was also our first time working with a database such as Firebase. We learned how to

## What's next for Wanderlust

The next steps include potentially turning it into an iOS/Android Mobile App. This is because after adding all their bookings, many people who go on vacation wouldn't take their laptop with them most of the time, and opening the app on a mobile web browser all the time would be difficult.

We would also like to update some of the features on the web application, including being able to delete trips and archive them, so you can still see them later on. A potential budget tracker is also in the talk.
